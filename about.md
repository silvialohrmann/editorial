In 2013, I registered my first unpublished work, called *The Soul's Perspective*. This was a second big step towards immersing myself into the publishing arena. The first one had been via my graphic designer bone[^1], through which I had earned a position as a layout artist in an aviation magazine. Thanks to this job, and other gigs of the kind, I got to learn a lot about editorial design.

So, even though I knew this first registered text needed a lot of work, a first milestone had been reached. Nevertheless, if I wanted to be published (or self-published), I had to learn to write professionally. 

First things first, and having done a great deal of research, I decided to jump into a translation course, the best I could find here in Buenos Aires (yes, I was raised in Argentina, and born, in 1969).

I started studying English-Spanish Literary Translation At Lenguas Vivas “Juan Ramón Fernández," and got almost halfway through my degree. At the time, I found it was the best way of learning to write properly[^2], both in Spanish and English. Because, against all good advice, I have always enjoyed writing my narrative in English.

Then, at one point, and following my intuition, I decided to turn towards studying Publishing. I knew there was this interesting course at Filo/UBA (Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at University of Buenos Aires) called *Edición*. It had started in 1992 offering a technical degree that a few years later changed into an undergraduate one[^3]. 

Slow-paced, I had passed five out of twenty-four subjects before the pandemic. Then, due to home-office, I could dedicate myself to studying non-stop for almost two years. Today, I'm two subjects away from graduation.

During quarantine, I also made the time to round up my writing of several years in three books. I had every intention of publishing them through Ingramspark, but chickened out and let them resting in the platform, a click away from reaching the world ☜(ˆ▽ˆ).

This year, I reread them and decided to publish them as they were. That's why I built this blog, to reedit the texts for a future second edition of each. The books are:

<h5>Notes</h5>

[^1]:	I obtained my Graphic Designer degree from FADU/UBA (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism at University of Buenos Aires).

[^2]:	As I'm writing this, I have dropped out of the Traductorado and enrolled in Artes de la Escritura (Writing Arts) at UNA (National University of The Arts), where one can become a writer. This undergraduate course was created in 2016. Its curriculum was insanely long, for which it was reformed in 2019 to make it possible for human students to get their degree.

[^3]:	The degree used to be called *Técnica en Edición*. Now it's *Editora* and they're going for *Licenciada en Edición*.
