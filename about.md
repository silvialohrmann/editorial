I've been writing –and entertaining the idea of being published– since my adolescence. As for reading, it's been my favorite activity for as long as I can remember, many years mostly done while commuting. This included any kind of material, from comics to Borges. I've always been in love with Cortázar, though.

In 2013, I registered my first unpublished work, called *The Soul's Perspective*. This was a second big step towards immersing myself into the publishing arena. The first one had been via my graphic designer bone[^1], through which I had earned a position as a layout artist in an aviation magazine. Thanks to this job, and other gigs of the kind, I got to learn a lot about editorial design.

So, even though I knew this first registered text needed a lot of work, a first milestone had been reached. Nevertheless, if I wanted to be published, I required two things: to really learn how to write and to know how an editor thinks. First things first, and having done my research, I decided to jump into a translation course, the best I could find here in Buenos Aires (yes, I was raised in Argentina, and born, in 1969).

At Lenguas Vivas “Juan Ramón Fernández,” I started studying English-Spanish Literary Translation, and got almost halfway through my degree. At the time, I found it was the best way of learning to write properly, both in Spanish and English. Because, against all good advice, I have always enjoyed writing my narrative in English.

At one point, and following my intuition, I decided to turn towards studying Publishing. I knew there was this interesting course at Filo/UBA called *Edición*. It had started in 1992 offering a technical degree that then changed into an undergraduate one. 

Low paced, I had passed five out of twenty-four subjects before the pandemic. Then, due to home-office, I could dedicate myself to studying non-stop for almost two years. At present, I'm two subjects away from graduation.

During quarantine, I also made the time to round up my writing of several years in three books. I had every intention of publishing them through Ingramspark, but chickened out and let them resting in the platform, a click away from reaching the world ☜(ˆ▽ˆ).

This year, I reread them and decided to publish them as they were. Then I built this blog to reedit the texts for a future second edition of each. The books are:

- *Intro*, an introspective narrative dealing with the relation universe-human.
- *Imaginable*, short narratives touching the concepts of death, afterlife, parallel lives and the dimensions of existence.
- *Multiversal*, a long story told from the viewpoint of a fifteen-year-old girl who lives with her mother and friends in a strange city that cyclically suffers a total reconfiguration.

In this blog, you'll also find a number of microstories I wrote between the years 2011 and 2016. I hope you like it.
