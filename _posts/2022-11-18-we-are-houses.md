At first I was amused, but then I felt fear, fear of never ever not knowing again. She looked a bit like me, or an older version of me. But I began to imagine that perhaps it was me who looked like her, who could alter events, who could play in this reality as a magician or witch. 

“Take care,” she said.

“Saturday at eight. In this same corner?” 

But no. I waited and waited. 

Had she also been waiting… disappointed, doubting my existence? I returned home very late that night. When I finally managed to fall asleep, something magical happened: Even though the intersecting streets had names I had never heard of, even though the city seemed less solid, the meeting finally took place.

We remembered our first encounter, as I remember it now, and several experiences shared in scenarios that I am unable to locate. When I woke up, I looked for something to write with: “I’m not what you think,” she’d said. *You’re not what you think*, I wrote. The Freudian slip made me ponder. Maybe we were the same in a way I failed to understand.

We are two, everywhere. This builds a dynamic that prevents stagnation. When we part, we always remember each other. But our ties remain covered by the emotional body when we immerse ourselves in places like Earth through the beings we project.

A state of bliss prevails, the feeling of being one and two at the same time. Together, as we are, we relate to others that are in the same way constituted (in pairs), and form groups that interact through the same underlying flow. The substance is one and constant throughout the universe, and universes communicate through it too. 

The zone of freedom of choice was created with the purpose of unlimited expansion and covered the creation of planets and densities. The most important —and difficult to carry out— phase was and is the physical layer of Earth. It was opened for experimentation so beings of diverse energetic levels could leave their mark. After a reasonable time, we had to preserve the area from an irreversible damage that would have led to the non-completion of the experiment.

We had to put a filter on the only door, which is neither physical nor energetic, but a thought of the universal mind. Access through it is now granted or not depending on the particular conditions of each entity.

From Earth, a particular projection gets in tune with me sometimes. When that happens, I get a warm sensation and feel the need to get closer, and I don’t know how, but I turn on and off, being her and me alternately.

In her mind (the real one) and all her bodies (houses within houses), she accumulates experience, the result of what you call trial and error, and we call life. For you, life is all to death. As we are neither dead nor alive, we can call life to something external to us and treat it as a mechanism.

My need to get close to her grew. That changed everything: Before I would never have questioned the refusal I received when I requested an extension of the permits. Now it becomes obvious that they let me carry this experiment out even though they could not openly encourage me.

For months she lived in the clouds, and her feet began to show the physical evidence. For me it was more than positive, for I received feelings of earthly experiences translated into universal code. Then it became a massive fact. We started to be bombarded with thoughts of all kind. The present moment was not enough to analyze, synthesize and archive that much data, and we had to unfold the permanent experience in compartments back and forth.

Files occupied so much space that our house had to duplicate and overlap itself. We couldn’t stop the process and had to duplicate also, both to ensure the archived data and to not vacate the place. Each house needs to be occupied, because anyone can access it if it is found uninhabited, receptive. 

I know it seems impossible that problems of space exist in the state we are in, but you must remember that the more interaction we have with our projections, the closer we get to their existential instance. Everything is produced through a self-generative mechanism of which is not necessary to know the details. 

In short: Empty places attract to themselves entities with which they can interact. When speaking of places or houses we are not referring to things, but beings, *things* only exist in the lowest density.

Our house has no definite shape, it is only a thought. We dwell in it with our intention.

*I’m surprised that I’m not thinking about killing myself.  I feel so bad… I’m a tumor operating itself.
I dreamed of Itna last night, of the giant wave, again. It was a calmed fear, that of dying. What really scared me was not seeing him again.*

Through dreams one can access other lives. These lives, which we believe to be past, actually occur simultaneously. This is a difficult concept for someone who unfolds in the linearity of time, but it’s important to adopt it, since the permeability that exists between events from different loops of experience explains the development of evolution.

Recognizing the purpose is capital. It is presented throughout your stay disguised in other things, but it is almost impossible to not know that a thread ties all together, that an arrow points to an end, it passes through each and everyone, and takes us somewhere.

We seek to expand our energy and, indeed, there is the risk of oblivion, but without that danger, that is true and relative at the same time, the game would stop. In short, it is the house that keeps us together. Even when we part, my partner always goes with me. 

From here we can appreciate how the livability of the houses develops in you. We see that anyone can be house and resident at the same time, and that one cannot occupy one’s own house-being (it is almost like the law of incest at a cosmic level). We can see the system clearly in the relationship my projection has with Atfa, who is the place where his friends and family live, and to whom she, in turn, offers shelter. Itna, is house to them both.

We can see that, as a child, Itna is in contact with information that remains elusive to adults, and that that knowledge is a non-knowledge, an openness to not categorize. Anyway, the timeframe of immunity to stereotypes since a person is born until they stupefy is dangerously narrowing.
<hr>
*Maybe it’s true. Maybe there is a purpose after all. Maybe it is worth living (and dying).
I get up to take Itna to school. We walk slowly, in silence, and I vaguely remember my dream, but I feel a deep pain anyway.*
<hr>
Multiple beings exist between my partner and me. They emerge from each of us in pairs, and they carry our essence. Each pair parts and reunites later in worlds of diverse densities. The game itself has nothing to do with finding ourselves through our projections, though this occurs frequently. We know it is an effect of expansion and try to make the best out of it. It is like a secondary game that generates more energy.

Some of our projections enter the world with great intensity, devoting to physically act in a practical way to help those who agreed to be part of *the final mass*. 

When the effects of the generated negativity couldn’t be reversed in time, many decided to act in that same manner. We must emphasize that it’s neither the only nor the best: Doing the opposite is equally appropriate and has its benefits towards the maintenance of balance and movement.

We noticed that family ties affect the healthy relationship between our projections. That love is distorted and diluted in the materiality of which its demonstrations are composed. Love itself is the flow of the substance —the one that conveys information and that is the medium that brings together all the components of the universe— through the entities. On Earth, the material (solidified energy) sucks in the non-material (information provided by high vibrational energy) to itself.

*Inertia makes life carry me. I’d rather disappear. I’m exhausted by discussions, by stupidity, not only of others, mine. I’m tired of being stupid. I’m tired of being.

*How to learn to die and be reborn without always trying to escape, without wasting time looking for gates that don’t exist (or that are so visible that it is as if they didn’t: the sky as a gate, or the sea)?*

*I have so little energy left that I think death can look like this. Permission to not do anything… as if I needed one. I play dead for a few days and recover strength, I get sick and stay in bed sleeping, dreaming, visiting other lives, more tender or darker, different, without fixed things: no son, no husband, no school, no work, no father, no mother, no train, no bus, no dishes… no me. Without me, because I vary. I rest from myself, I jump from dream to dream and things don’t attach to me. Everything stays in the dream I dreamed I was dreaming.*

*I turn on the light to go to the bathroom and I realize that everything is weird, that things no more have a defined border, that some luminous dots dance. That everything is made of the same, drawn on a single mesh. I pee and go back to bed. I lie: First I spy on Itna, who is shining (literally).*

*If I die, will I care to have left people I love here? Or is it as if awakening to another life and believing that the previous one was invented, unreal? When I wake up, what happens to those I abandon in the dream? Versions and versions of repeated people, of children, of friends, of relatives who change roles from one story to another. How to keep count, how to know who is more real?*

*My life starts to be controlled by my nocturnal activity, in which everything is suited to me, in which I feel life more intimately. It is as if my spirit entered me, as if I enlarged. I make room for him to accommodate and be able to feel everything.*

Inter-livability allows you to live sheltered by other beings. This doesn’t mean you have to feed off the energy available in the beings that host you, though it happens a lot. The system itself is a gift through which those involved can eventually access us more easily. We speak of the ones involved because there is the possibility of not partaking in the game of the houses while still being part of the game on Earth. You don’t remember that.

Oblivion is the backbone of our project. (With our we mean yours and ours.) Everything is organized around it. 

Going to the world is dying. That is why our projections must be highly specialized to resonate with the Earth’s field. Not all the portions the soul casts have that ability, that’s why they plan a journey to other places first, a tour through planets and dimensions that prepare them better. 

“Why did you wake me?… Could you pass me the aspirins? My head is killing me.”
“So you could take the aspirin, that’s why I woke you,” says Atfa. He has the crazy idea that he can read minds.

“While I was asleep I didn’t notice I had a headache.”

“Coffee?”

“No, thanks. I’d rather keep sleeping.”

I dream I’m in a large room shaped like an amphitheater. They are explaining how things work on Earth and give us tips on how to achieve any goal there. 

Upon waking, I find everyday life very hard to face, the contrast is almost unbearable to me. Luckily, chatting with Itna all the way to school helps me enter the world slowly.
