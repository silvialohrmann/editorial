You I did see: plaid pants, black hat, black long coat. The staircase was narrow, steep and made of cement. Covered with dirt. Why I liked the ladder (that way, dirty and sad): because I knew of your other lives.

I knew one in which you were not poor, in which you could have taken me to a better place. Unfortunately for me, in that other life you didn't know me.

The urge of being together led us up to the door (small). The stairs and the door predicted a miserable room.
