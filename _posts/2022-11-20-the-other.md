I always do this for the drain not to clog. It’s disgusting, but what I’m going to tell you is even worse. I was showering. I had already made my little hairball and put it carefully over the sink. It was then when my thoughts unexpectedly became indomitable.

Even though I tried to trick my mind by introducing new subjects through which it could divert itself: the pimple on my face, the wall fungus, my wish to be free —really free—, I could not get rid of this insane and unusual idea. 

That, making use of a mixture of mental power —a clean guided thought— and feeling, I could breathe life into my hairball (the little ball that I always do with the hair that comes out when I wash my head). And that there was only one substance that, if applied at the moment of alchemy, was able to boycott this procedure.

Fear. In fact, it is fear what prevents all kind of miracles that a human being is able to perform. And it’s not you fear failure. Having success at an enterprise of that sort would put you in such an unexpected place that, for a moment, you’d be lost. That moment terrifies you.

But you started slowly to move. Obviously, I couldn’t believe it at first, but... you were walking. I stood still, so stiff I was that I immobilized you. You looked at me for a while and then jumped. I mean, you were still a hairball. You were my hair with little legs (of hair) walking, with little eyes (of hair) staring. Then you were no longer made of hair. You were a cockroach.

At that moment, an encompassing thought arose in me. It didn’t get to be a thought. It was half way between a thought and a feeling.

I saw myself in you, cockroach, and somehow I knew it. I was you, thinking like you, feeling your feelings. I was on my side too, horrified.

The night came. In my sleep, your tiny legs caressed my hair. I was dreaming I was you, that you were with me, that the worlds hadn’t separated to let us do our thing. The unreal reality I had lived the day before blended with the real unreality of my dream. While you hid under my pillow and, like me, slept for a while, you weren’t the hair roach anymore, you were a beautiful being, a mixture between butterfly and seahorse. 

At some moment, our dreams merged and you weren’t the flying seahorse anymore, nor were you the little ball of hair breathed with life. You were a simple hairball, what you always wanted to be, what you had always been. I too was dreaming of going back to my original state, to my world, where I wasn’t dependant on a body or on physical laws. Then, at one point, the reality of normal life woke up.

I searched everywhere: under the bed, in the living-room, inside the toilet… no noise gave you away. Cruch, cruch, cruch… I wanted to hear, but… nothing.

Who would have thought that I would worry about the fate of a cockroach. On other times, disgust would have seized me to such a point that I wouldn’t even have had the courage to step on you, the mere thought of the sound of your exoskeleton breaking and the white juice coming out would have paralyzed me.

Now, the simple thought of something bad happening to you gave me an infinite sadness. I wanted you with me, caressing me with your tiny antennae as before, sleeping under my pillow.

Then, in the mirror, I saw you. You barely moved your leg. You had settled into my hair to be consistent, or warmer. But it didn’t bother me, what’s more, I liked it because I had forgotten a little bit that you were a cockroach and had rememberes more that you came from me, from my hair, from my will to create you. You came from my life because you were in it and you were part of me for that. It was me the cockroach… IT WAS ME THE COCKROACH.

I wake up all sweaty an run to the bathroom. In the mirror I am not able to distinguish it, so blended with my other hairs. Underneath my pillow there was one hair, but that is not forceful proof. I make myself a coffee and still feel the dream all over my body.
