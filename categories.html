<p>These Categories are the titles of three books I edited during 2020 (and finally published in December 2022) plus some *Microstories* taken from a blog I wrote for several years but is no longer public. The books are:</p>
    <ul class="category-list">
<li>*Intro*, an introspective narrative divided into different themes dealing with the relation universe-human.</li>
<li>*Imaginable*, short narratives ranging from fantasy to the fantastic and touching the concepts of death, afterlife, parallel lives and the different dimensions of existence.</li>
<li>*Multiversal*, kind of a novella or long story told from the point of view of a fifteen-year-old girl who lives with her mother and friends in a strange city that cyclically suffers a total reconfiguration.</li>
    </ul>
